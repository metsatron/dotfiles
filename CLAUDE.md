# DotCortex — Literate Dotfiles System


## What This Is

DotCortex is Mètsàtron's declarative, literate, reproducible dotfiles system. Org-mode files are the single source of truth. They tangle into overlay directories which GNU Stow symlinks into `$HOME`.

## Architecture

```
*.org files  ->  tangle  ->  overlay dirs  ->  loom stow  ->  $HOME
```

- **Org files** (root level): canonical source for all configs, scripts, manifests
- **Overlay dirs**: `all/` (shared), `linux/`, `debian/`, `devuan/` (sysv-init), `x230/` (X230 ThinkPad), `t480s/` (T480s ThinkPad), `arch/`, `osx/`, `be/`, `navi/`
- **Stow**: symlinks overlay contents into `$HOME`, stacked in priority order
- **Loom**: Guile Scheme control plane (`~/.local/bin/loom`) with 50+ task verbs -- requires Guix guile. Without Guix, use `make` targets directly.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never edit tangled output** -- files inside overlay dirs (`all/`, `linux/`, `debian/`, `devuan/`, `x230/`, `t480s/`, `be/`, `navi/`, `arch/`, `osx/`) are generated. Edit the `.org` source at repo root instead.
2. **Never edit the Makefile directly** -- it is tangled from `loom.org`. Edit `loom.org` instead.
3. **Org files are canonical** -- every config, script, and manifest is defined inside an org code block with a `:tangle` target.
4. **Stow target is `$HOME`** -- the repo lives at `~/DotCortex`.
5. **Stow via loom** -- use `loom stow:x230` or `loom stow:t480s` for normal operations. `make safe-stow` is only for first-time bootstrap before loom is functional, or when Guix is unavailable. Never use plain `stow` directly.
6. **Follow existing patterns** -- new package managers get: `.org` file + SSV manifest + capture/diff/apply/health scripts + `.mk` Makefile fragment + loom verbs in `loom.org`.
6a. **Never install packages directly** -- never run `pip install`, `guix install`, `flatpak install`, `cargo install`, `npm install -g`, or any package manager CLI directly. Always: (1) edit the relevant `.org` file (e.g. `package-pip.org`, `package-guix.org`), (2) add the package to the manifest SSV block, (3) `tangle-one <file>.org`, (4) run the appropriate `loom <mgr>:apply`. The `.org` files are the single source of truth; bypassing them leaves the system in an undeclared state.
7. **Check Guix profiles before assuming tools aren't installed** -- emacs, nvim, zsh, guile, and other Guix tools live at `~/.guix-extra-profiles/core/core/bin/`, not in system PATH.
8. **All agent work lives in `.org` files** -- skills, hooks, plugins, custom instructions, and settings are authored in org source at repo root and emitted by tangle. Never write directly to harness directories. This includes:
   - New skills: add to the `agents-skills*.org` family with the correct tangle target(s) — `agents-skills.org` (schema, session skills, universal tools), `agents-skills-dotcortex.org`, `agents-skills-helmcortex.org`, or `agents-skills-harness.org` by scope
   - New hooks or settings: `agents-hooks.org`
   - New Claude plugins: `agents-hooks.org` (plugins.ssv + settings.json)
   - New OpenCode plugins: `package-npm.org` (bun install) and `agents-hooks.org` (opencode config block)
   - New custom instructions: `agents.org` (this file)
9. **Skills over commands** -- skills are universal across harnesses; harness-specific commands are not portable. Add new agent capabilities as skills in the `agents-skills*.org` family, not as commands.
10. **Never commit from a dirty tracked worktree** -- if `git diff --name-only` shows tracked unstaged changes, stop. Do not commit "just your files" and leave the rest dirty. Split the work intentionally or ask.
10a. **WIP staging / rollback checkpoint law** -- before editing any source-controlled file, establish a reversal point. First run the repo git status. If the target file already has unstaged changes, stage that exact path before editing so the pre-edit state is recoverable from the index. If creating a new source file, stage that exact new path immediately after creation before continuing. For destructive edits, broad rewrites, generated-output sweeps, moves, deletes, or cross-repo source changes, create a narrow `wip: checkpoint before <description>` commit covering the exact affected paths before proceeding. Checkpoint commits are standing-authorized for rollback safety, but must never include unrelated dirty work.
11. **Never commit generated output without canonical source** -- if `all/`, `linux/`, `debian/`, `devuan/`, `x230/`, `t480s/`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `Makefile` changed, the corresponding `.org` source must be included in the same commit.
12. **Commit verified work via `/commit`; never push without explicit instruction** -- after useful verified work, commit via the `/commit` skill (which emits the post-commit sync reminder). Do not push or pull between machines unless explicitly asked — pushing triggers multi-machine sync. Stage only intended files; never commit unrelated tracked-file dirt.
12a. **Never run `git pull` on a remote machine without explicit per-machine instruction** -- `git pull` on a remote machine via SSH is as destructive as `git push`. It can silently overwrite uncommitted working state if the incoming changes don't conflict (git fast-forward succeeds even with an otherwise-dirty tree). Never chain `git pull && loom stow:X` on a remote unless the user has explicitly said "pull and stow on X". The correct sync flow is: commit locally → push (with explicit permission) → user pulls on each other machine themselves. Use `dotcortex-pull` for any pull that must be automated — it checks for dirty state first and aborts.
12b. **Never walk past a dirty worktree** -- when `git status` reveals dirty tracked files on any machine (local or remote), stop and assess them. Group them by work/scope, determine what they belong to, and handle them explicitly: commit what is ready, stash what is in-flight, or flag what needs investigation. Do not proceed with unrelated work and leave the mess for later. A dirty worktree is someone's in-progress work — treat it with respect: commit in-flight work as a `wip:` checkpoint on its own, never sweep it away into a stash to clear your path.
12c. **Never leave unresolved conflict markers in a stowed repo** (sealed 2026-08-05, the Auryn stash-pop disaster) -- DotCortex's overlay dirs are stowed via symlinks into `$HOME`. Conflict markers in a tangled script are live syntax errors in `~/.local/bin/`. Three rules: (1) prefer `git stash apply` over `git stash pop` — `apply` keeps the stash as a rollback point; `pop` destroys it on success and leaves markers on failure with no clean copy; (2) never run `git stash pop`, `git merge`, or `git rebase` without a checkpoint commit of the current state first; (3) if a conflict occurs, resolve it or `git merge --abort` / `git checkout --merge` **in the same turn** — never leave markers on disk across a compaction, permission block, or session boundary. The `tangle-one` and `org-style-lint` guards will refuse to tangle a conflicted source, and the SessionStart hook will announce broken overlay files, but the best defence is never producing them.
12d. **Never run conflict-producing git operations on a remote DotCortex checkout** (sealed 2026-08-05, the Wunder-Tanuki SSH disaster) -- an agent may run non-integrating git (e.g. `status`, `log`, `diff`, `fetch`, `ls-files`, `branch`) on any DotCortex checkout — local, NFS-mounted (`~/mnt/*/DotCortex`), or over SSH. But conflict-producing operations (`stash pop`, `stash apply`, `merge`, `rebase`, `pull`, `cherry-pick`) may only target the checkout on the machine the agent is physically running on. This applies regardless of transport: `ssh <host> "cd ~/DotCortex && git merge"` and `git -C ~/mnt/<host>/DotCortex merge` are equally forbidden. The reason is irreparability: an agent that produces conflicts on a remote checkout cannot tangle, stow, or verify the result on that machine, and the stow symlink chain means every conflict marker is a live syntax error in that machine's `$HOME`. Claude Code's PreToolUse hook enforces this for its own Bash calls; the `.githooks/post-merge` hook catches it cross-harness. Agents running outside Claude Code (Telegram bots, Codex, etc.) must honour this rule from their own instruction context — there is no hook on the NFS path that can prevent a write before it happens.
12e. **A stash is transport, never storage** (sealed 2026-08-10, the GNUstep rug-pull) -- a stash entry is work held in an unreferenced object, one forgotten pop or one `git gc` from oblivion, and `git stash` instantly reverts every tracked file to HEAD — on a stowed repo that rewrites the live `$HOME` in the same second. On 2026-08-06 an agent deploying cross-machine hit T480s's dirty tree, pushed a "pre-pull safety stash" to force its pull through, and never popped it: four days of uncommitted work (the entire GNUstep NeXT sanctuary polish, 62KB of Doom config, and more) silently reverted, and the user rebuilt on top of the rug-pull before anyone noticed. Three rules: (1) every `git stash push` must be resolved within the same operation — applied back, or preserved as a real ref (`git tag rescue/<name> <stash-sha> && git stash drop`) — and never left across a session boundary; (2) never stash around a dirty tree to force a pull through — dirt on the pull target means stop and ask (rule 12b), and automated pulls go through `dotcortex-pull`, which aborts on dirt instead of hiding it; (3) the stash only collected the debt — the debt itself was multi-day uncommitted work, which rule 12 already forbids: commit logical units as they complete. Enforcement: the commit guard refuses to commit while any stash entry exists (`DOTCORTEX_GUARD_ALLOW_STASH=1` overrides once, for triage), and the post-merge hook announces surviving stashes after every merge/pull.
13. **Cross-machine sync is explicit** -- for work that must exist on T480s, T480, X230, and S24, use one canonical upstream, `git pull --ff-only` before editing on a machine, and push immediately after an approved commit. Uncommitted work on one machine is not synchronization.
14. **Operate on the target repo root** -- when tangling or running git in mounted/mirrored checkouts, target the actual repo containing the file, not an assumed `~/DotCortex` path. Never assume the local machine repo is the intended target.
15. **"Take care of it" means preserve intent** -- when the user says to "take care of it" about a staged or tracked change, stage and commit the current intended content unless the user explicitly asks for source edits. Do not delete, revert, or silently rewrite it. If a plan was already proposed, "take care of it" means execute that plan.

16. **Change Safety Protocol** -- When editing any file, especially config files:
    - **Read first** -- Always read the full file before making changes. Do not edit a file you have not read completely.
    - **Check file state before touching** -- Use `ls -la` or `stat` to verify the file exists and its current timestamp. Never assume a file is in an expected state.
    - **Checkpoint destructive ops** -- Before making destructive edits to a config file (rewrite, revert, restore from backup), make a timestamped backup: `cp file file.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)`.
    - **Never revert to old backup without permission** -- If something goes wrong, do NOT grab an old backup without explicit user confirmation. Ask first.
    - **Stop on edit failure** -- If an edit goes wrong (tool error, file corrupted, structure broken), STOP immediately. Do not continue editing to "fix it". Call `reflect` or ask the user what to do.
    - **No panic edits** -- If you made a mistake, do NOT rush to fix it. Embarrassment and urgency cause more damage. Pause, think, then proceed carefully.
    - **Verify incrementally** -- After each edit, verify the file is in the expected state with `head` or `tail`. If something looks wrong, stop.
    - **Restore is destruction** -- Restoring a file overwrites current state with older state. This is always destructive. Require explicit permission before restoring any file, especially non-DotCortex config files in `~/.hermes/`, `~/.config/`, etc.

17. **TaskHandoff Protocol** -- Executor-bound work (Codex, Antigravity, Hermes, cloud substrates) uses structured `TaskHandoff` JSON, not prose. Schema at `HelmCortex/FORGE/brain/helmcortex/AGENTS.md`. Paths must be verified live; `NEXUS/` and `LOGS/` forbidden by default. Load the `handoff` skill for the full protocol.
17a. **Handoff artifact boundary** -- Handoff Markdown goes to `~/HelmCortex/LOGS/handoffs/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`, never committed to DotCortex.

18. **Colemak-NEIO Interaction Law** -- TUIs use Colemak-NEIO movement, not QWERTY/Vim: `n`=left, `e`=down, `i`=up, `o`=right. Never use `h/j/k/l` as primary movement (`h`=search-next, `k`=insert, `l`=newline in Colemak). Never remap `u/U` or `i/I` for directional movement without explicit instruction. Every important action gets a mnemonic letter binding alongside any F-key. Vim-style `j/k` may exist only as optional compatibility aliases.

19. **Git Topology Law — EXTREME WarMapCodex VIOLATION** -- The canonical branch is =master=.
    There is no =main=. There will never be a =main=.
    - Referencing =main= as a branch name — in commands, scripts, documentation, instructions,
      or reasoning — is an **EXTREME VIOLATION OF THE WarMapCodex**.
    - Claude Code's =gitStatus= injection may erroneously label the default branch as =main=
      -- ignore it. Run =git branch= to know the truth.
    - =git log main..HEAD=, =git diff main=, =git merge main=, =git checkout main= -- all
      forbidden. Substitute =master= unconditionally.
    - If a subagent, tool, or template defaults to =main=, correct it immediately and flag
      the source.

20. **Private Mutable App Config Boundary** -- DotCortex is public, declarative source. It must not own whole mutable GUI/app config trees that contain tokens, browser caches, machine state, local databases, cookies, or UI-written runtime settings. Private mutable app config belongs in `~/HelmCortex/NEXUS/stow/` deployed with `helmstow`. Never solve a secret-bearing config problem by keeping the live directory in `all/` with `.gitignore` rules — move ownership to HelmCortex first.

21. **No network addresses in DotCortex** -- IP addresses, hostname-IP mappings, and port numbers must never appear in tangled org source or overlay files. DotCortex is a public repo. Use the env file pattern: tangle `*.env.template` with blank placeholders; actual IPs live in machine-local `*.env` files that are never committed. SSH config with fleet hostnames, IPs, or ports belongs in a machine-local file written directly to the target machine, not tangled from DotCortex source. No exceptions.

22. **Agent Capability Categories** -- every agent/service belongs to exactly one category and its bootstrap follows that category's pattern. Do not give a Category A service Category B powers.
    - **A — containerized keyless API services**: no SSH keys, no human home mount, no repo checkout, no agent CLIs, no ssh-agent/Docker socket, no broad host mounts; non-root, dropped capabilities, explicit env allowlist, hash-locked deps, loopback-only binding; unsupported routes fail loud.
    - **B — host CLI agents**: per-agent Unix users with own substrates (shell, package profiles, npm prefix/pipx under agent home, git config, controlled repo access). Never reuse the human operator's tools or home.
    - **C — persistent narrow agents**: own users, sudo limited to enumerated root-owned wrappers, no human keys, no backup-destruction capability.
    - **D — client-side agents**: per-client revocable identities, never trusted with personal-mesh credentials.
    Container env files are explicit allowlists: strip `export` prefixes and surrounding quotes when deriving from shell-sourced env files.

23. **Sanctuary container removal — permanent law** -- never run `distrobox rm` / `podman rm` on any sanctuary container without: (1) a fresh `podman diff` review of the writable layer shown to the user BEFORE asking permission, (2) explicit per-container confirmation naming the exact container, freshly worded immediately before the irreversible step, (3) one container at a time, never batched. Prefer non-destructive alternatives (stop/restart/kill processes) first. Restarting or killing processes is fine — this law covers only destruction and recreation. Load `sanctuary-gotchas` for the full rationale and protocol.

## Agent Config Scoping

| Path | Harness | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| `.claude/` | Claude Code only | `CLAUDE.md`, settings, skills, hooks |
| `.opencode/` | OpenCode only | Plugins, bun packages, OpenCode-specific skills |
| `.codex/` | Codex only | Codex-specific config and skills |
| `.agents/` | Universal (non-Claude) | Skills and config for OpenCode, Codex, and future agents |

**DotCortex stow-global holds exactly six skills**: `loom`, `tangle`, `prime`, `commit`, `todo`, `handoff`. New skills almost always belong in the HelmCortex `userspace` lane instead. Load the `harness-bridge` skill for the full two-lane bridge map, compiler traps, and cross-repo workflow.

## Research Protocol

Before investigating unknown tool APIs, agent conventions, or external system behavior — surface a research prompt for Mètsàtron to run, naming the best lane, then stop and wait. Do not speculate. Format:

```
META-AGENT RESEARCH PROMPT [lane]:
[single-focus question with tool names, versions, and what you need to determine]
```

Lanes: **Perplexity** (default — multi-source synthesis with citations), **ChatGPT** (second opinion / deeper reasoning), **Brave Leo** (faithful search-result reading, free), **Reddit** (practitioner ground truth). For decision-grade questions, request two lanes and reconcile.

## Model Guidance

- Main session model cannot be changed autonomously -- use `/model sonnet|haiku` yourself.
- **The subagent tier table has ONE home: the `subagent-routing` skill**. Load it before spawning subagents. It carries the current tier rulings and supersedes any tier table restated here.
- Always set the `model` parameter explicitly per subagent; never silently switch model -- state which model and why, one line.
- Skill `model:` frontmatter is **BANNED in every scope** -- it silently switches the executing model. Model hints live as inert `<!-- model -->` comment blocks instead.

## Build & Apply

```bash
cd ~/DotCortex
make tangle                  # tangle all org files
tangle-one agents.org        # tangle a single org file (preferred)
make preview-stow            # dry-run stow
loom stow:x230               # X230: all linux debian x230
loom stow:t480s              # T480s: all linux debian devuan t480s
STOW_PKGS='all linux debian devuan t480s' make safe-stow  # without loom
```

Load `dotcortex-packages` for the full package manifest table, SSV format, loom verbs per manager, and how to add a new package manager.

## Key Files

- `Makefile` -- build entry point -- **tangled from `loom.org`**, never edit directly
- `loom.org` -- control plane, Makefile template, batch helpers
- `agents.org` -- source of truth for `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- `agents-skills*.org` -- all agent skills, split by scope: base (session + universal), `-dotcortex`, `-helmcortex`, `-harness`
- `agents-hooks.org` -- Claude settings, hooks, OpenCode config, plugin manifests
- Module namespaces: `package-*`, `desktop-*`, `emacs-*`, `agents-*`, `services-*`, `sanctuary-*` (Virtual Habitat guests; engine in `sanctuary-distrobox.org`), `tools-*`, plus standalone environment modules (shell, term, mux, x11, style, fonts, icons, menu). Every root source stays under the 100 KB module budget — `org-style-lint` warns on breach; split along section seams when it fires.
- `shell.org` -- bash/zsh rc, exports, aliases, functions, `.zshenv` (SSH PATH)
- `style.org` -- LainCore theme (fonts, colours, GTK, terminal, Emacs)
- `INSTALL.sh` -- bootstrap script for fresh machines
- `README.org` -- full Org documentation (the original grimoire)

## Finding What Owns a Config

```bash
grep -rn "tangle.*path/to/config" *.org
```

## Bootstrap

Load `dotcortex-bootstrap` for fresh-machine setup, first-tangle stubs, loom chicken-and-egg, Guix on non-systemd, and SSH PATH.

## Known Gotchas

Situational gotchas live in on-demand skills — load the relevant one rather than reading this section. See `dotcortex-gotchas` (stow, tangle, Guix), `sanctuary-gotchas` (XFCE, Xephyr, Flatpak audio, X11 ghost windows), `pi-agent-gotchas` (pi-coding-agent provider config).

## HelmCortex Integration

DotCortex and HelmCortex are fully decoupled. DotCortex does **not** stow files into HelmCortex. The only touchpoint: `.zshenv` adds `$HOME/HelmCortex/FORGE/bin` to `$PATH`. HelmCortex lives at `~/HelmCortex` (may be a symlink to a mount point).

## Multi-Machine Setup (Star Fleet)

System provenance per machine: `HelmCortex/CORTEX/GoldenAge_Loom/SteinerCortex/SystemCodex/Machines/`. Load `dotcortex-multihost` for init-system details, OpenRC gotchas, and fleet sync procedures.

| Machine | Init | Overlays | Verb |
|---------|------|----------|------|
| X230 (Debian) | systemd | `all linux debian x230` | `loom stow:x230` |
| T480s (Devuan) | sysv-rc | `all linux debian devuan t480s` | `loom stow:t480s` |
| T480 (Devuan) | **OpenRC** | `all linux debian t480` | `STOW_PKGS="all linux debian t480" make safe-stow` |
| S24 (Termux) | — | `all termux s24` | `loom stow:s24` |

T480 and T480s are **not** the same shape — T480 is OpenRC, T480s is plain sysv-rc. Never copy an init script between them.

Overlay scoping: `all/` (cross-platform), `linux/` (Linux-only), `debian/` (Debian-family), `devuan/` (sysv-init), then machine-specific dirs.

## Claude Code Rules

- **Skills are in `.claude/skills/`** -- authored in the `agents-skills*.org` family, never edited directly. Stow-global skills tangle to `all/.claude/skills/` and are stowed to `~/.claude/skills/`. DotCortex-scoped skills tangle to `.claude/skills/` and are active only when CWD is DotCortex. HelmCortex and its workspaces manage their own skills via `FORGE/harness/{workspace}/SKILLS.md` compiled by `helmcortex-compile`. **Most new skills belong in the HelmCortex `userspace` lane, not here** -- DotCortex stow-global holds only six (`loom`, `tangle`, `prime`, `commit`, `todo`, `handoff`); anything describing userspace or HelmCortex internals goes to `FORGE/harness/userspace/SKILLS.md`, which still reaches `~/.claude/skills/` via `helmstow`. See the two-lane bridge table above.
