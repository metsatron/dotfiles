# /commit — Structured Git Commit

You are creating a well-structured git commit. The user may provide a hint: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Run `git status` (never `-uall`) and `git diff --staged` + `git diff` to understand all changes.

2. **Classify the change type:**
   - `feat` — new feature or capability
   - `fix` — bug fix
   - `refactor` — restructuring without behavior change
   - `docs` — documentation only
   - `chore` — maintenance, config, dependencies
   - `tangle` — org source block changes that affect tangled output

3. **Determine scope from file paths:**
   - `emacs` — emacs.org, Spacemacs config
   - `shell` — shell.org, bash/zsh config
   - `flatpak` — flatpak.org, Flatpak management
   - `loom` — loom.org, Makefile, control plane
   - `style` — style.org, LainCore theme
   - `tools` — tools.org, misc tooling
   - `stow` — overlay dirs, stow config
   - `pkg` — package manifests (pip, npm, cargo, guix, etc.)
   - Use the most specific scope that fits

4. **Build the commit message:**
   ```
   TYPE(SCOPE): one-line summary (imperative mood, <72 chars)

   - bullet point details of what changed
   - focus on WHY not just WHAT

   ```

5. **Refresh visibility before staging:**
   - If the work changes outstanding tasks, update the relevant `~/HelmCortex/LOGS/TODO/{workspace}.md` file.
   - If the work is machine-specific, update `~/HelmCortex/LOGS/TODO/Machines/{hostname}.md`.
   - If a durable lesson crystallized, run or recommend `/reflect` and persist the lesson to the narrowest real source of truth before committing.
   - If no TODO or reflection update is warranted, say so briefly in the commit report.

6. **Stage specific files** — NEVER use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Add files by name. If unsure which files belong, ask.

7. **Commit** using a HEREDOC for the message to preserve formatting.

8. Show `git log -1` to confirm.

9. **Post-commit sync reminder** — after every DotCortex commit, remind the user to sync other machines:
   - Push when ready: `git push`
   - On each other machine with a separate DotCortex checkout (X230, T480s, or any SSH-connected host):
     ```
     git pull --ff-only
     loom stow:x230      # or loom stow:t480s — match the target machine
     ```
   - If the repo is NFS-mounted (same working tree, no separate checkout), no pull is needed — but stow must still be re-run on each machine that needs the updated symlinks.
   - If a machine cannot fast-forward (diverged history), stop and investigate before merging.

## Rules

- If there are no changes, say so and stop.
- Refuse to commit from a dirty tracked worktree. If tracked unstaged changes exist outside the intended commit, stop and ask the user whether to split, stage, or stash them first.
- If changes span multiple unrelated scopes, suggest splitting into multiple commits.
- If the user's hint conflicts with what the diff shows, trust the diff.
- Never commit generated/tangled output without the canonical `.org` source in the same commit.
- Never use `git add .`, `git add -A`, or a broad pathspec that sweeps unrelated files into the commit.
- Cross-machine sync is always explicit: `git pull --ff-only` before editing on any machine, push immediately after an approved commit. Uncommitted work on one machine is not synchronisation.
- Never push directly to a remote working tree over SSH without confirming it is clean — a dirty remote will reject the push or fall out of sync with stow.
- Do not push unless explicitly asked.
- Remember: `.org` files are the source of truth, tangled output files are generated.
- Commit closeout is a visibility gate: TODO state and reflection-worthy lessons should not be left only in chat context.
